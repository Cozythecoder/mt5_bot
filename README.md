# mt5_bot

The main purpose of creating this bot is to make it easier to execute orders. this bot gets trade details from specific telegram channels and executes orders on MT5 ( using MT5 API Library )

I specifically run this bot 24/7. so, I can forward trade signal to my telegram channel and this bot will do its job (execute an order on MT5)
